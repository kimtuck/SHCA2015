Hi Laurie,

The following can be put on our website:



Hi Stephanie,

They can start making reservations at any time. Below is the online and call in booking information for your records. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Below you will find two direct links to online reservations. Either one of those links may be added to your website. I have also included instructions for booking from the Capitol Plaza Website. Those booking instructions may be posted to your site or they may be sent out in any publications for the conference.

- Direct links to reservations (no group code required):

- Instructions for booking on the Capitol Plaza Website or calling the hotel directly (*please note two different codes depending on how the reservation is booked):

Reservations can be made online at www.capitolplazahoteltopeka.com Click on “Reservations” and you will be redirected to reservations page.  Select “Group Code” and enter code HUSKY for the discounted rate. Once the code is entered, you will be able to select the dates and book your reservation. OR, call the hotel directly at (800) 579-7937 (please mention you are part of Siberian Husky Club of America or group code SHCA).
